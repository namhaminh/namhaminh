## Welcome to the Nam Ha Minh's official GitHub repositories
This GitHub account hosts reference projects for my courses on Udemy:

These projects are private, meaning that you need to have permission to get the code. Only paid students will be granted access, so if you're one of my students, please request access by sending me a message on Udemy.
#### To get my public code, kindly check [CodeJava.net GitHub](https://github.com/codejava-official) page.
